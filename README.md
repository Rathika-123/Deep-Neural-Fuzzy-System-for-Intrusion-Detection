# Deep-Neural-Fuzzy-System-for-Intrusion-Detection
This project presents a Deep Neural Fuzzy System (DNFS) for Intrusion Detection in network traffic. It combines multiple deep learning models, including LSTM, CNN, DNN, and MLP, along with fuzzy logic for robust decision-making. This approach leverages the strengths of various architectures to enhance intrusion detection accuracy in both time-series and non-sequential data.
## System Architecture

The architecture of a DNFS is as follows:

1. **Input Layer:** Receives the input data.
2. **Feature Extraction Layer:** Uses a variety of neural network architectures, such as MLP, DNN, CNN, and LSTM, to extract features from the input data.
3. **Deep Neural Fuzzy Layer:**  Applies fuzzy logic to the extracted features, allowing the model to capture complex relationships and handle uncertainty.
4. **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction.
